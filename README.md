# ScheduleMaker
Class Schedule Maker - Capstone group project
@author Jeff Chapin - This is a desktop application written in Java. I wrote the Main class including the JavaFX GUI in the start method.
My team members wrote the code for the file conversion components of the application (not found in the repository). 

This was from a group project for my class Application Programming and Development. The program takes input of a .csv file 
containing information for courses in the Computer Science department (CRN, name, instructor, room number etc) and outputs a .csmo file 
for use on freecollegeschedulemaker.com which uses the file to create a graphical classroom schedule of department courses.

Using the GUI of the JavaFX application a user can select the import file button and select the .csv to use. Then the user has options 
to choose from on how they would like the .csmo to be customized. They can select specific rooms, create multiple files, fill empty
space. Then they select convert to .csmo button to create the .csmo file which is outputed to the same system directory as the input
file.
